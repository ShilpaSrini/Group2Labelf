# Group2Labelf


**Labelf Project -- Group 2**
**


**Goals:**

The tasks of group 2 include Logging into the account of Labelf.ai, uploading a dataset “Ebike”, creating the labels, training the model, deploying the APIs, and making inference on the models.

But during the project, through discussing with our customer we decide to **focus only** on certain tasks such as uploading the dataset, creating the labels, and exploring the APIs and credentials by both executing manual tests and automated tests.

The arrangement of the works we could see clearly from Jira and the table below:
